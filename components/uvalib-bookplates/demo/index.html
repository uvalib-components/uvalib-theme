            <p>The University of Virginia Library's electronic bookplate program recognizes the generous support of endowments and gifts in building and caring for our wide variety of collections.</p>
            <p>Electronic bookplates supplement online catalog records to convey rich information about our donors and the nature of their gifts. Items in our catalog that were purchased with donor funds are assigned a virtual bookplate image, which points visitors to a detailed description of the associated fund and all other acquisitions made with it. This approach extends donor recognition from print materials to the online Library catalog where visitors from all over the world come to discover what we have to offer. Here, visitors can see the entire breadth of materials acquired by the generosity of our appreciated supports.</p>
